          <h4>I never believed working out less will actually be beneficial than working out more, that's until I met Pratyaksh! His ideology on how to get the perfect physique might sound complete opposite to the conventional ways, but trust me his
            route is far more enjoyable and sustainable. I never imagined that I could pull off this transformation being involved in a job which requires me to be in the sky most of the time during my day.</h6>

          <h5>Trust me or not the before picture was taken when I was 92kgs. The after pic was taken exactly after 90 days. I was eating like a maniac back then and had lost all the motivation to hit the gym. There was not even a single day when I
            did not have my home made large ice cream shake. However, I decided to change myself getting inspired the by the transformation that pratyaksh (my colleague) did while coming to office, that too while eating what he loved. I was lucky
            enough to get the knowledge about food combinations and macros. He used to eat out almost everyday and was still in line with his physique. Imagine Spending 5k a month on supplements and spending the same or less amount on whole natural
            food getting the same results. To be honest I gave it a try believing that it will fail miserably, but today I am stand at a healthy weight making sure that I eat right calories and burn them the right way in gym. Thanks to Team
            NoSupplements for turning this dream into a reality </h5>

          <h4>I have been working out for a while, unable to see any result, desperate, I approached Pratyaksh for guidance and lo and behold within two months I started seeing significant gains and that too without any supplements. Apart from that,
            I feel energetic throught out the day and now enjoy all type of food and still manage to maintain my waistline. As they say that knowledge is power, Pratyaksh Seth is proven that often times having great and applicable knowledge can match
            the outcome of having experience in a certain field. Not only that, the way of sharing knowledge is also an art and he knows how to pass on the correct knowledge in the right way. Highly recommend anyone struggling with their fitness
            goals to consult with Team NoSupplements.</h4>

          <h4>I met pratyaksh in my college days. Struggling to lose weight at that time, I met pratyaksh who had recently done a transformation in front of my eyes. Keen to know exactly how he did it, I approached him. I was astonished to find that
            he never starved himself unlike me and was still able to pull off the process with ease. His guidance and meal plans helped me a lot. He told me some great hacks which were so helpful whenever I went out to eat. I would highly recommend
            his guidance to anyone who is overweight and has no clue how to lose all that fat. Kudos to Team NoSupplements! As they say that knowledge is power, Pratyaksh Seth is proven that often times having great and applicable knowledge can match
